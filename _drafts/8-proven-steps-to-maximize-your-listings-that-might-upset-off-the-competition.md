I’ve been in the real estate business for over 35 years, and during that time I’ve helped over 3,000 families with their real estate needs. Over the years, I developed a nearly full-proof technique to maximize a home’s value and capture an additional two to three buyers on almost every listing. For example, do you know the exact time you should activate your listing? To learn about my eight proven steps, watch this short video.

I’ve been in the real estate business for over 35 years, and during that time I’ve helped over 3,000 families with their real estate needs. Over the years, I developed a nearly full-proof technique to maximize a home’s value and capture an additional two to three buyers on almost every listing.&nbsp;

Here are the eight steps that I’ve integrated into my approach:&nbsp;

1. **Price for attention.** There cannot be any doubt in the buyer’s mind when the walk in the home that it’s priced correctly.&nbsp;
2. **Get a professional photographer in for pictures by Wednesday.** Doing this will mean you can get those stellar photos back by Friday, just in time to entice weekend shoppers.&nbsp;
3. **Activate the listing Friday.** There are ten times as many eyeballs peering over listings on Friday afternoon than any other time of the week.&nbsp;
4. **Create fear of loss.** Here’s the tricky part: Do not let anyone see the home for the next nine days after the listing goes active. Then, on that Sunday, hold a mega open house. Keep buyers thinking that your home could go off the market at any time. {% include pullquote.html %}
5. **Get your open house signs up.** Do this one week from when the list goes active, and make sure you saturate the area—open house signs on every corner\!&nbsp;
6. **More signs, more attention.** That following Sunday, put even more signs out, this time with balloons attached. Do whatever you can to make the open house experience seem special and interesting.&nbsp;
7. **Get a partner.** Make sure you have a partner with you; when people try to capture everyone on their own, they end up capturing no one.&nbsp;
8. **Have a hook.** What is your simple, quick line to say that best encapsulates all the features of your house that buyers will find attractive? Find it, know it, use it, repeat it. Speak to the paying points.
