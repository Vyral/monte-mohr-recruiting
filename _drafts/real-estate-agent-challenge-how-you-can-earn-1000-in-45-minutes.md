Are you a real estate agent? Do you want to get a $1,000 check in 45 minutes? I have a challenge for you\!\!&nbsp;

{% include youtube.html %}

This is my challenge to every realtor out there that I know: if we don't offer as much, or more, than you're currently getting in training, in tools, in technology, in support, or bottom line commission value, then I will pay you $1,000.

$1,000 for sitting down for 45 minutes and looking at what we have. If you can look me in the eyes and tell me that what you have now is greater than that, I will write you a check on the spot for $1,000. \#TalkMusicCity
