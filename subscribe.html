<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in Nashville?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 33,000 homes sold in the greater middle Tennessee market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell over 600 homes last year, or $192,000,000.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"When you work with someone who’s been in the business for 35 years, you gain knowledge that would take me forever to learn. Having him available for calls, consultation and coaching, has been invaluable to me. He’s really taught me to look at things in a different way."</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"I knew Monte at another brokerage, he had an excellent reputation. I was leaving that brokerage and heard that Monte had a brokerage now, and I knew I wanted to connect with him because I respected his history and reputation in the business. He’s really creative in what he does and I wanted to be associated with that."</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"One thing that Monte does, as far as training goes, that has really left a lasting impression is his encouragement to be creative and step outside the box of “normal” realtors. He really empowers you to be as creative as possible in this competitive landscape and really allows us to be the best resource to our clients at all times."</p>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:monte@realtyonemusiccity.com">monte@realtyonemusiccity.com</a>. </p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents in Nashville.</p>
