<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you are probably already working at a brokerage, or maybe out there on your own trying to make it big in the real estate business.</p>

<p>Let me guess: You probably aren’t getting the support that you need in order to advance your career. Many brokerages don’t offer the leads, training, coaching, accountability, or structure required to succeed. Because of this, 87% of real estate agents will fail to achieve the level of success they want and leave the industry within their first 18 months.</p>

<p>Have you noticed how crowded the market has gotten lately? On top of having more agents than ever before to compete with, we also have to contend with real estate disruptors like Open Door, Redfin, and Zillow Offers, who are coming in and trying to take our business from us.</p>

<p>You might long for a kind of lifestyle that your current job can’t afford you—the freedom to maintain your life outside of work as you please, the money to support your family as well as your personal goals, and the time to make all of it a reality.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve already sought out a solution to these problems. There are numerous companies out there that promise to deliver quality leads that you can convert to clients, therefore allowing you to grow in your business and in life. The trouble is, many of these are merely marketing mirages designed only to recruit you to build someone else’s business, not to nurture your professional and personal interests and build your personal brand and future. </p>

<p>Most of us know that “if we continue to do what we’ve always done, we’re going to continue to get what we’ve always gotten”</p>

<p>Don’t let your frustrations, anxieties, and past misfortunes get you down. There is a solution to your problems, and it doesn’t involve letting the real estate business chew you up and spit you out:</p>

<p>I’d like to invite you in for a discussion about becoming a member of our brokerage.</p>

<p>My name is Monte Mohr and I’ve personally closed over 3,000 homes ($1 billion) in my 35+ years in the business. Instead of remaining a top producer, my job now is helping my agents become their very best in this business. I’ve been through all the ups and downs that this business has to offer and I’m here to share my knowledge and experience with agents who are looking to take the next step in their careers.</p>

<p>What makes Realty ONE Group Music City different from the rest? Well, we don’t offer smoke and mirrors to the agents we recruit AND I <strong>personally</strong> stand behind our promises. </p>

<p>We’ve built a proven, repeatable system that can take average agents and turn them into extraordinary agents. Though our office is less than 1 year old, the agents that we have attracted so far are responsible for over $150,000,000 in residential sales production over the past 12 months. In other words, good and great agents are recognizing and then experiencing why Realty ONE Group is the fastest growing real estate franchise in the nation. Simply stated, we have “everything Top and “future” Top Agents are looking for.” </p>

<p>Let me be a little more specific about what our company offers:
<ul class="indent">
<li>A strong mentorship program with true experienced and <strong>available</strong> leadership</li>
<li>Guidance creating unique selling propositions to compete with the disruptors</li>
<li>Over 500 hours of FREE world-class online training on Every R.E. Topic</li>
<li>Strong core values we not only claim, but actually walk out daily</li>
<li>Thousands of dollars of cutting-edge technology- FREE</li>
<li>A Strong National Brand that puts the Agent First</li>
<li>Access to Team and Individual leads sources</li>
<li>Active team communication with 60+ agents</li>
<li>Weekly live training and master mind group</li>
<li>Same day direct deposit for commissions</li>
<li>A new highly visible, easy access office</li>
<li>A collaborative, team environment</li>
<li>Top tier systems and support</li>
<li>Relaxed office environment</li>
<li>A non-competing broker</li>
<li>$150/month office fee</li>
<li>$495 transaction fee</li>
<li>100% commission</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I know, where’s the catch right? There is no catch, except this, to consider: what would your business look like IF you had all the above. Chances are, where you are now, you don’t. And IF by chance you already do have what I’ve shared here, then stay where you are at because what you have is already far better than most. </p>

<p>By joining our brokerage, you’ll experience fast and sustainable career growth, as well as access to the income and freedom you desire. This is all achievable through the quality leads we provide, our proven systems, and the technology we use to help you leverage your time and convert leads into clients. </p>

<p>If you’re skeptical, you don’t need to take my word for it. Let the success of a few of our agents speak for itself, and you can make up your own mind about it:</p>

<p>Rick came to us six months ago after working for the No.1 team in Middle Tennessee on a 50/50 split. He has sold more homes at 100% commission in the last six months on our team than he did in the prior calendar year.</p>

<p>Erica was also working with another brokerage and struggling after only a year in the business. She joined us four months ago, and has already closed more deals with our company than she did in the last year. She said she’s learned more in her first training with us than she did in an entire year with a big-box brokerage.</p>

<p>If you take me up on my offer to have a discussion about whether our team is right for you, I’d be glad to show you that we’re not just talk—we can prove what we say actually happens.</p>

<p>Then again, you could also elect to go a different route. But I’ll warn you: Other big-box brokerages often foster a dog-eat-dog atmosphere in which you’re technically a part of the brand, but you’re still left to succeed (or fail) on your own. Many will spend a lot of their time calling or texting you so they can recruit you, but once you’re there, they don’t provide the resources you need to grow your business. Others still will promise you quality leads but, in reality, will provide you with weak Facebook leads from people who aren’t really interested in buying or selling homes.</p>

<p>The choice is yours: Face an uncertain industry full of mirages and false promises on your own—or become an agent in our family of professionals. If you join us, I’ll be invested in your success from day one. As a matter of fact, I guarantee you that if you need to get ahold of me and I don’t call you back by the end of the day, I’ll pay you $100.</p>

<p>When you join our team, the onboarding process starts right away. We’ll get you started with training, get you set up with a mentor if you need one, and show you the step-by-step processes that make our company unique. </p>

<p>If your interest has been piqued, reach out to me today. The popular real estate services, Redfin and OpenDoor, are gearing up for a massive advertising campaign across the USA to offer clients a low-commission environment and iBuyer purchases that don’t include agents in the mix. If local agents don’t have their business systems in place before then, many will get left behind or worse, crushed.</p>

<p>Let’s get on this now so we can build a moat around your mindset, skill set, and most importantly, your database, allowing us to make sure you succeed in real estate regardless of what happens next.</p>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

<p>Monte Mohr</p>
