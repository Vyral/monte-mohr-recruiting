<center><em>If you&rsquo;re looking to mentor newer agents, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.</em></center>

&nbsp;

The Realty One Group is growing, and we’re attracting both experienced agents and those who are newer to the real estate business.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

We want to make sure those who are new to the industry are mentored properly and acquire the necessary skills as quickly as possible, and the best way to achieve this is through a good mentoring program. We have the classes and the heart of the topic in place, so **we’re looking for experienced agents to join our team who have a passion for mentorship.**&nbsp;

We’re not asking anyone to mentor a whole bunch of new agents; we limit our mentors to three or four mentees at a time because we also want them out selling real estate without any interruptions.&nbsp;

We know for a fact that mentorship helps the mentor as well. To paraphrase Stephen Covey, **we only know what we can effectively teach others,** and this is a great opportunity for anyone with a teacher’s heart.&nbsp;

If you’d like to take advantage of this opportunity, give me a call. I look forward to hearing from you.
