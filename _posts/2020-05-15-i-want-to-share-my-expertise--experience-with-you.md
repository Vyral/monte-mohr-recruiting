The situation in real estate right now is pretty crazy.

As we speak, hundreds of agents are deactivating their licenses because the business has gotten tougher. This is to be expected, though, because a chunk of the population in our industry isn’t fully committed to it.&nbsp;

With that in mind, I have a simple message to share with you: **Before the message matters, people have to believe the messenger.** I’ve been doing this for 36 years. I’ve sold over $1 billion in volume and have helped over 3,000 families buy or sell homes. Though I’m not a competing broker with the other agents in my office, I’m still an active broker, and part of the reason is that I want to feel the pain of the market in today’s world and be relevant to our agents.&nbsp;

On that note, **I want to share my expertise and experience with other local agents in the area who are perhaps in need of a lifeline.** Maybe you don’t feel certain about a listing’s value, or you’re not sure what to do about a certain situation. I’m not saying I have all the answers, but I want to do my part to elevate the expertise in our industry and raise the bar. Specifically, I want to help you convey your value to the consumer.&nbsp;

Remember, prosperity follows value. If you want to make more in any business, you have to become more. Right now, business probably isn’t as busy as you’d like it to be, so it’s a great opportunity to become an expert in every topic that resonates with who you are.&nbsp;

Hang in there, and keep doing what you do best. If there’s anything I can do to help you, call my cell at (615) 300-8393. I won’t take on any liability, but I am taking on the care and concern of the expertise in our industry so I can help you raise the bar.

As always, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.
