Today Mike Todd of IRA Innovations joins us to give us an introduction to self-directed IRAs. Their niche is showing people how they can invest their retirement plans into alternative investments (meaning besides the stock market), and real estate is the No. 1 investment choice that their clients choose. You never know what the stock market will do, but real estate, though it may go up and down a bit, will always improve. “Self-directed” is just a term within the industry that means you go find the investment yourself.
