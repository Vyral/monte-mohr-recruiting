I recall early on in my career when I would bounce from one task to another, seeking satisfaction, and I would forget to enjoy the ride along the way. I looked at what very successful entrepreneurs were doing and found that they had multiple businesses, and not just for income. **They genuinely enjoy creating, building, and designing businesses, and I think that real estate agents should learn from that.**

In the real estate industry, there’s something new every day, be that a new person to meet or a new scenario to engage with. That’s part of what makes it so fun\! And toward the end of each year, we assess what we did in the past year and what we wanted to do. Then, in December, we start putting together ways to implement our plans for the next year. This phase of the year is exciting for me because it’s a chance to be artistic with our business practices—what can we do better next year? Once we’ve taken a two-week break at the end of the year, we come back refreshed and ready for what’s to come.

The great thing about being a business owner is that **nobody is stopping us from raising the bar with each new year.** A career in real estate will only feel like a job if you let it take control of you. If you take control and start with a strong foundation, you can ultimately decide how much you get paid and how successful you are. What is a success, anyway? In our industry, success is ultimately defined by each individual business owner.

If you have any questions about taking the reins of your business or how to get into a mindset that’s more conducive to success, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you and share our wisdom with you.
