<center><em>The best working relationships are grounded in this simple acronym.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Here’s a simple acronym that has been helpful over the years in my real estate career. You should always be seeking people who are:&nbsp;

* M: Motivated&nbsp;
* Q: Qualified&nbsp;
* C: Coachable&nbsp;
* A: Appreciative&nbsp;

If they’re not motivated, it’s as futile as trying to push a string uphill. Without qualifications, it’s a waste of time. If your clients are not coachable, it’s like having a 3-year-old who wants to drive the bus; they’ll continue to yank the steering wheel from you and needlessly drive their real estate dreams down a bumpy road. Lastly, ‘A’ is self-explanatory—we all want to be appreciated.&nbsp;

I’ve helped over 3,000 families buy and sell real estate over the last 30+ years, and this is what I’ve learned: If people are missing one of those four pillars, then getting to the finish line will likely be a frustrating affair. **Every day, remind yourself that you’re only seeking motivated, qualified, coachable, and appreciative buyers and sellers.** As you gain more experience and are able to offer more value, you’ll attract that clientele more easily.&nbsp;

Likewise, we’re only looking for MQCA individuals to come work for us at Realty One Group. If they’re not motivated, they’ll probably end up wanting to do something else as a career—real estate is not easy. Are they committed to learning what’s necessary to become a qualified real estate agent? This industry is changing almost daily, so it’s important that they remain coachable. Lastly, they should appreciate the broker, the leadership, and the trainers who are helping them achieve excellence.&nbsp;

If you have questions about real estate or how to practically apply MQCA, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I’m here to be a resource for you.
