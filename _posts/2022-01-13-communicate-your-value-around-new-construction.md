We’re headed towards a world of media. More and more, buyers feel like they can do their research and find their own homes online, especially when they’re dealing with new construction. We can’t change the way things are headed, but **we can better communicate our value to buyers.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

We bring our expertise to the home-building process. Since we do this every day, **we can bring more information about the process, provide more accountability for the builders, and advocate for the buyers.** They should work with an agent because they don’t want to shortcut the biggest and most important investment of their life. It’s important to have this conversation with the buyer on the front end instead of trying to redeem a failing relationship later.&nbsp;

With rates as low as they are, buyers can usually afford much more than they think, which is something else you can educate them on. For new construction right now, we can lock in rates for 180 days with only $1,000 of holding that’s fully refundable. But as with any mortgage perks, it’s important to look at all the numbers because some lenders may try to add costs into other parts of the loan.

If you have questions about communicating your value, feel free to give us a call. I’d love to hear from you.
