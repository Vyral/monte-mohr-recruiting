*Here’s what I do to let my database know that I’m always here for them. *

I’m a non-competing broker but still an active one, and that’s because **I have a conviction that I can be of far greater value to my agents if I’m still out there experiencing the pains of our current market**—not a market I knew five, 10, or 15 years ago.&nbsp;

Everyone in this industry strives to stay top-of-mind for a database of people who know, like, and trust them. What I’ve found to be **one of the most effective and simplest ways to follow up with your database is to drop folks a postcard.**&nbsp;

There are different approaches to postcard content (i.e., recipes, recent listings, quotes, etc.), but I find it useful to think about it as a time issue: people will be walking from the mailbox to the garbage can, so what can I see in a matter of a few seconds that will grab their attention? I choose to say something inspirational, like the following:&nbsp; “Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, a love of what you’re doing.”&nbsp;

I choose this route to hit that part of a person’s brain that suggests to them that this is a positive encounter with me; on the back of the postcard, I have a picture of myself, a call to action, an engaging question, and a message of gratitude. It’s basic, but enables me to stay top of mind without hitting people over the head all of the time with some exhausted plea.&nbsp;

The last thing you want to do is give somebody something that has no value. **Given the world today, most people are always thankful to receive some meaningful inspiration.** In addition to postcards, I’ll often write a personalized note—something simple, like, “Hey Bob and Sally, just want to let you know I appreciate you.” These are the little things that enable me to sell two to three homes per month on autopilot mode; I stay on people’s minds and leave a feeling of positivity.&nbsp;
