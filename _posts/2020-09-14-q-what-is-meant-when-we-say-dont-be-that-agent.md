<center><em>Here&rsquo;s why we as professionals must always position ourselves as experts. </em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp; What does it mean when I say, “Don’t be that agent?” It means to not be the agent who’s trying to learn on the fly. **I see some agents lose control of a transaction because they failed to emphasize their expertise to their clients—don’t be that agent.&nbsp;**

Here’s an example: I recently had a hot listing. It was a beautifully staged home with fresh paint that was priced correctly. Within the first couple of days of hitting the market, I had two agents whose clients expressed interest in it. One agent wanted to know how old the roof was, who had done the work, what the HOA policies consisted of, etc. She was trying to cover all her bases and sort out all the minutiae.&nbsp;

The other agent, however, brought in a full-price offer with some concessions, which they rescinded after we countered. This agent’s client accepted our counteroffer. When that first agent reached out again and said their clients were ready to make an offer, I relayed to her the disappointing news that someone else had bought the home the day prior.&nbsp;

Here’s the lesson: **The inquiries the first agent raised were admirable, but they were all things that can be addressed*****after \*\****an offer has been submitted.\*\* Granted, she may have had some very detailed clients, but nevertheless, we mustn’t forget that as professionals we bring value to the marketplace by being an expert; if you’re not acting like the expert, then the person who *thinks* they’re an expert will take the wheel from you and try to steer the process (aka your client).&nbsp;

The agent who lost out in this example should have considered telling her clients this: “All these things you want to know about the house can be explored *during* the 10-day inspection period. In the meantime, if we want to make an offer on this home, we need to do it now.” **Be the agent who gets the home off the market first, and then does their due diligence to make sure everything is right.&nbsp;**
