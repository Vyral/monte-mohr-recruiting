*When I read “The Miracle Morning for Real Estate Agents,” it changed my life and career. It can do the same for you.*

Two years ago, I read a book entitled “The Miracle Morning for Real Estate Agents: It’s Your Time to Rise and Shine” by Hal Elrod, Michael J. Maher, and Michael Reese. At the age of 67, I can tell you that my life changed when I read it and started applying its lessons to my life.

One memorable aspect of the book was the acronym SAVERS, which stands for:

* **Silence**\: Meditation. Prayer. Breathing. Whatever it is for you, the idea is to quiet your mind and block out the noise.

* **Affirmations**\: Write down encouraging words to help you achieve your goals, overcome your fears, be healthy, and find success.

* **Visualization**\: Visualize your business as you want to see it. Visualize qualified, motivated, appreciative, and coachable clients coming to you for business.

* **Exercise**\: Make sure that you get some type of exercise, even if it’s only for five or 10 minutes each morning.

* **Reading**\: Read plenty of books and other materials like “The Miracle Morning” to take in as much good advice as possible and to hone your thought process for success.

* **Scribing**\: Take some time to write down what’s in your heart and mind.

The wisdom in this book is incredible, and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’d like to receive a free copy or have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to send you one so you can start implementing its life-changing tips in your own business.
