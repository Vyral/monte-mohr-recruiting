Welcome back to part two of my discussion with Mike Todd from IRA Innovations, where we’re rounding out our conversation about self-directed IRAs. Last time, we talked about how real estate is an excellent investment alternative to the stock market in terms of forming a retirement plan. Today we’re diving deeper into the topic by talking about funding your IRA with cash, private lending practices, and real estate investments.
