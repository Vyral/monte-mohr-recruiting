<center><em>Here&rsquo;s the key to start selling more than one home per month.</em></center>

&nbsp;

There’s only one way to get yourself to a place where you’re consistently selling more than one house a month, and that is to **leverage yourself.** The first time I hired someone to help me with the details (I’m not really a fine-details kind of guy), I saw my business *double.* Originally, I didn’t think I could afford the cost of help, but then I realized that I was already incurring the cost myself while simultaneously inhibiting my growth. Investing in help was the right call. &nbsp;

I’m a big advocate of using a local company here called Contract to Close. Toni White is the owner (her number is 615-289-1452), and I honestly don’t know what I’d do without her. I know it may seem odd that I’m spending my time and dollar promoting a business that gives me nothing in return for doing so, but **I believe in the need to walk in excellence as a real estate professional; get the things that you’re not great at off of your plate.&nbsp;**

Handing off the details frees up more time for you to do the things that you’re excellent at—or that you need to *become* excellent at anyhow. Remember: Your excellence is in serving the local person who knows, likes, and trusts you, whether you’re helping them buy or sell, or just locate the best painter in town.&nbsp;

**If you’re doing the details, you’re never going to get off the ground.** Momentum is the secret to this business, and you will never achieve it if you insist on controlling all of the details. Even if you’re a control freak like me, you need to let go of those things that you really don’t need to have your hand on. Let someone who’s a professional in that area handle it. Did you know there are somewhere between 18 and 20 hours of details in every transaction? Imagine all of the things you could be doing with that time to grow your business.&nbsp;

When you grow your business, you’re becoming more proficient at what you do, and that means you’re able to be better for those who need you most. How can you expect to become excellent at something if you’re only doing it a couple of times throughout the year? If you help somebody buy a home and hand off the details to someone like Toni at Contract to Close, you’ll be able to jump right back into helping some other couple or family find a home and build momentum.&nbsp;

Stop sinking time on the tasks that you could delegate to someone else who will do them better—because that’s *all* they do. I recommend seeking out a local contract-to-close professional; it’s the best way to start freeing up your time and reducing unnecessary stress.&nbsp;
