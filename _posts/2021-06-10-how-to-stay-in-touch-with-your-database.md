<center><em>Here are a couple of the ways we stay in touch with our past clients.</em></center>

Once you’ve finished a transaction with a client, it’s important to keep in contact with them. Beyond just being my past clients’ go-to person for all their real estate needs, **I like to send out postcards to them.** Now, I understand that in all likelihood, those postcards are headed straight to the trash, so I want them to be impactful and inspiring on their way to the garbage. On these postcards, I include:

* A picture of me so that the clients know who is inspiring them
* A call to action on the back that touches on what’s important to them
* A thank-you for their support
* A reminder that the highest form of flattery they can give me is a referral to their family and friends

Additionally, we’ll send out a monthly email accompanied by a market update. At the bottom of these emails, we leave a link for people who are curious about their home values. It’s non-threatening, non-aggressive, and surprisingly simple to do. I’ve been very surprised with how many responses that we’ve gotten from them.

To send out these emails, **we use a service called Woodpecker.** At first, we tried a more complex format of a newsletter with a lot of information, but then we decided to simplify it with a short blurb from me where I summarize the market statistics. If we gave people all the information, they’d have nothing to call us for. With Woodpecker, we can upload our prospects list and send out emails one at a time so that spam filters don’t register that we’ve sent out a mass email to 200 people. From the clients’ perspective, they simply look like they’ve received an email directly from our team, and our response rate has increased since we started using that medium.

If you have any questions about how we keep in contact with our database or would like advice about boosting your own methods, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Monte Mohr Team. We’d love to help you.
