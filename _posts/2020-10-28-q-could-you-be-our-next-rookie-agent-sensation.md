<center><em>We&rsquo;re looking for more new agents like these to help us grow.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Our team is growing and we’re looking for really great people who would make excellent real estate agents. **Lately, we’re finding our newest people are getting some of the most incredible results.** For example,

• Marbelin Curiel has only been licensed for four months but already has eight closings.

• Sam Ghali has been licensed for just nine months and has had 20 closings already.

• Kirolos Hanna, after two years in the business, has already sold upwards of 80 properties.

**This isn’t the easiest business, but our mentorship program is built to help put agents on the path to success.** Each new agent is provided a mentor who has a mentor of their own. Building a strong foundation like this in your business is extremely important for future success.

If you have any questions for us about our team or what a career with us could look like, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
