<center><em>This is one main difference between real estate agents and professionals.</em></center>
&nbsp;


Would you hire a builder to build your dream home if you knew they had to borrow a hammer and saw to do the job? It’s the same for real estate professionals. **Real estate agents are different from real estate professionals.&nbsp;**

Professionals will invest in their business; we won’t find them borrowing open house signs or lock boxes. Of course, sometimes something unforeseen happens, you may be short of one, etc. However, it’s often a distressing shock to me to find out how many agents out there don’t have the equipment for success. If you lack the basics, what is that saying about your business?&nbsp;

**Our goal is to build a database full of people who know, like, and trust us, and that starts with trusting ourselves.** Are you committed to this as a career, or is this just a fun, part-time thing? I encourage you to get the tools you need because along with them comes the conviction that you’re the professional they need to hire. Show that you’re the one who can help with their real estate needs.
