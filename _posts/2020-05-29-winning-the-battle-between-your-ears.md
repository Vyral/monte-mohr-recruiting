&nbsp;

The other day, someone said to me, “Monte, I’m new in the business and I want to become a billion-dollar broker like you. What do I do?”

I paused for a second and thought that I couldn’t really credit anything other than longevity in the industry. Throughout my 36 years in the business, I’ve been truly committed to it.&nbsp;

I kept going back to this question, though, and I think the most important step is **winning the battle between your ears.** It’s easy to blame something on the economy, our political leadership, or a global pandemic, but at the end of the day, we have to own what’s decided in our heads. Are you going to win that battle? How do you win that battle?

I believe you win it by **keeping yourself fed with the&nbsp;*****right*** **information.** For example, one of my favorite books of all time is “The Prosperity Battle,” which is a compilation of 18 of the best books ever written about prosperity. The first book is “Think and Grow Rich,” by Napoleon Hill—an absolute classic.&nbsp;

If you want to become a billion-dollar broker, be committed in your heart of hearts to winning the battle between your ears and feed yourself with positive information. Stay focused on that. Continue to love and honor people and put others’ needs above your own. After that, hang on for one of the craziest rides of your life because you have the opportunity to make a difference on this planet and become who you’re destined to be.&nbsp;

I wish you luck, and remember: I’m here to serve you if I can help you with your real estate career. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
