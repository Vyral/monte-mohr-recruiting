What do you think about when you’re starting your business? I’ve always said that to be a good business owner, you have to ask a lot of questions. Today I’m talking with Blake Johnson about what methods he uses to strengthen his business.&nbsp;

Our company offers weekly foundation classes and Blake supports these meetings. **For him, you can never build a strong business without a strong foundation.** Would you rather build a house on sand or stone? For most people the answer is obvious, and when you’re building a business, it is no different.&nbsp;

Blake also thinks we need to get our mindset right before we can achieve our goals. He says, **“Our interior is far superior to our exterior.”** What he means by this is that we need to be mindful of our self-talk and what messages we say to ourselves. Whether you are serving someone a Starbucks drink or helping executives find high-end housing, mindset can make all the difference.&nbsp;

**Our team agrees that your internal foundation is what matters most.** Real estate can be a bit of a roller coaster sometimes. That’s why a lot of people love the job. However, this also means we need to make sure our foundations are strong so that we are prepared when the unexpected happens.

There are probably people watching who are older and feel like it’s too late to start their own business, but it is never too late. The founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken didn’t get his break until his 50’s\! **The truth is, you can start your own business however you want to make it, but it starts within.&nbsp;**

If you have questions about today’s topic or if you have any other real estate questions, do not hesitate to give us a call. Our team is always willing to help.
