On this episode of “The Talk of Music City Real Estate,” we have a guest joining us whom I’m very excited to talk to: JB Biffle of Mosquito Joe. It’s important to study other businesses and industries to better learn how to serve your own clients, and JB will discuss how his company functions and all the services they offer. More importantly, he’ll discuss how they can take care of any pesky insects that might be intruding on your summer fun.&nbsp;
