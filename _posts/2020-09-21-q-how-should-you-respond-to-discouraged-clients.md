Living in the belt buckle of the Bible Belt is a great thing, especially if you’re a Christian. However, it’s amazing how many times people run into a tough spot during their real estate transactions and resign themselves, saying, “Well, maybe God doesn’t want me to have that house.”

**My typical response is to tell them that I don’t think God wanted me to get into real estate, either.&nbsp;**

36 years ago during my first transaction, I was having a tough time finding a home for a buyer. When I finally did, the appraisal said that it needed a new roof. However, the seller didn’t have the money for a new roof. The buyer offered to do it himself, and he ended up putting a new roof on a house that he didn’t even own.

On the day of closing, when everyone gathered at the table to get this deal done, my buyers were nowhere to be found. When I finally got a phone call from them, I was concerned that something terrible had happened—and it sure did: The buyers had lost their down payment they intended to bring to the table.

At that time, the seller’s broker said to me, “Monte, do you see the sheriff’s car parked outside?”

I did see it. He told me that they had written checks already because they had anticipated closing the previous week, and if we didn’t present the funds that day, the sheriff was going to take my client to jail for having written bad checks.

Mind you, this was my first transaction, and nothing seemed to go right at first. However, **we were able to keep everything together and the deal ended up working out (with no one going to jail).&nbsp;**

Sometimes life can be tough, but the point of my story today was to tell you not to give up when things get tough. Sometimes your clients will think that a home simply isn’t meant to be, but sticking to the plan can pay off.

If there’s ever a time when I can help you with your real estate career, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to share my advice and experience with you.
