Coach Bill Maddox is our latest guest on “The Talk of Music City.” He’s the CEO of Blue Dress Inc., an internet marketing company. He has a ton of great insight into the market, becoming known in a commoditized industry like real estate, and how he has found success as both a real estate investor and coach. In part one of our conversation, Bill is sharing his story, his best advice for Realtors, and what he’s learned from his failures.
