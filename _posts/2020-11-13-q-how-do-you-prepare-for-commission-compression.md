\*Here are my thoughts on how to prepare for commission compression. \*

A few weeks ago, an article was posted on [Inman](https://www.inman.com/2020/10/29/not-if-but-when-why-you-should-be-preparing-for-commission-compression-now/) about a very interesting topic that I want to delve into today: **commission compression.**&nbsp;

As you can see in the link, the article begins by stating, “Consumer behavior, demand, and expectations are going to reduce commissions. It’s a matter of when, not if.” That’s a little concerning to me—what does commission compression mean, exactly? I think it indicates downward pressure. In other words, what used to be one number is now a lesser number, on average.&nbsp;

What are your options in preparing for commission compression? Do you sell your home and buy a smaller one? Or get rid of your car and buy a smaller one? Those are both viable routes, but a more practical and meaningful option, in my opinion, is to **stop leaving money on the table and consider working for an organization that pays you a higher percentage,** such as Benchmark Realty, Synergy Real Estate Group, or Realty ONE Group Music City.&nbsp;

We consider ourselves the best of all arenas. We don’t just offer 100% commission; we also provide the training, tools, resources, and great office locations agents need to truly thrive. **When commission compression reaches Inman’s headlines, it’s time to stop ignoring it and start preparing for it.&nbsp;**

If you’d like to talk more about preparing for commission compression or have any real estate questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d love to speak with you.
