&nbsp;

What does it mean when your broker says they’re a non-competing broker? Well, in some perspectives, it may mean that they haven’t sold a home in the last six years, which is fine—being a broker requires a lot of focus. In my case, **I’m a non-competing broker yet I’m a relevant broker because I’m still active in the market.&nbsp;**

I will never compete with my agents, and, as a matter of fact, I’ll help them get business. There have been many times where I’ve accompanied agents to listing appointments; though they seldom need my help, I’m always happy to oblige if they’d feel more assured bringing some gray hairs into a specific situation—I have plenty to lend\!&nbsp;

There’s more than just one connotation of the title of ‘non-competing broker.’ Are you working for a non-competing broker who hasn’t sold anything for a while, or are you working for a non-competing broker who is relevant to today’s market? I feel the pain that you feel out there as a real estate agent. I’m not rattling off cliches from a bygone era of buying and selling.&nbsp;**I’m leveraging years of experience to help you make sense of what’s happening right now in real estate.&nbsp;**
