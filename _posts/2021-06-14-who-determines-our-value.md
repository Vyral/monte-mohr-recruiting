Are we seeing the writing on the wall for traditional approaches to value? As you’ll see in today’s excerpt from the show, there are plenty of competing philosophies on this topic. What’s clear, however, is that the landscape is changing; for agents to establish long-term relevance, we must start acting a bit differently.
