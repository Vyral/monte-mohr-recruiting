Today I want to share how I received my hunger for learning.&nbsp;

Things weren’t great in my life at one time: **I was a laid-off factory worker who qualified for food stamps.** One evening I went to church and a gentleman in our congregation who knew I was having a difficult time handed me a $100 bill and said: “Monte, go buy yourself a new pair of shoes.” He’d noticed my socks were hanging out of the bottom of my current pair. He also handed me a book called “See You at the Top,” by Zig Ziglar.&nbsp;

I’ve talked about some of the books that have changed my life before, but this was the first one. The main thing I learned from “See You at the Top” is that if you simply help enough people get what they’re searching for in life, you’ll certainly get what you’re searching for. **You’ll be blessed if you help others.&nbsp;**

Becoming a billion-dollar real estate broker has been quite a journey—it took me 36 years. I often say that you must win the battle in your own mind before anything else can happen for you. My goal is to help real estate agents succeed sooner than I did. I believe that **success leaves clues,** and those of us who have found it can help others find it too.&nbsp;

If I can ever assist you with your real estate needs, please call or email me. Let me be your lifeline if you’re in a real estate transaction you don’t know how to navigate. I would love to help you.
