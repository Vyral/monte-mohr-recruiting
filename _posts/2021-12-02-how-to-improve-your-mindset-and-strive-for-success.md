Hey guys. Today, I’m sharing a short clip from my new business podcast, The Talk of Music City. In today’s clip, the gang and I go over how we prepare mentally to be the best agents we can be. We're also joined by Lauren Weibert, a Proctor Gallagher Consultant who teaches her clients how to think into their results.

We start off by discussing ways we can get in the right mindset while working from home. **For example, maybe dressing in your most confident business attire for an important zoom meeting can help put you in the right mindset.** Even if no one can see below your waist, wearing your best heels could give your mindset an edge.&nbsp;

**It’s important to stay completely focused on your task at hand.** We even bring up the metaphor of a horse with blinders on. When it comes to your career, you want to have the mental strength to put those blinders on so that you can stay focused on what’s important. If you start sidetracking into less important things, it can distract you from what matters most.&nbsp;

Later, Lauren runs us through her process to get her mind in the right place for business. Her process comes from Bob Proctor, and it’s called Thinking Into Results. **She says the number one question people need to ask themselves is, “Am I ready to invest in myself?”** Transformation takes both time and money, so you need to be willing to commit before you really get started. She doesn’t focus on one-hour training sessions or behavioral changes; rather, she’s looking to teach people how to think.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If any of this sounds interesting to you, check out our full podcast, The Talk of Music City. Also, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to me. I’m always willing to help.
